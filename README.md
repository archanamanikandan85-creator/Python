# Python
This project develops an AI-driven safety system using Machine Learning (Random Forest/Neural Networks) to predict road accident risks. By analyzing variables like speed, weather, and driver behavior, the system calculates accident probability and provides real-time alerts, aiming to reduce fatalities through data-backed prevention.
